synopsis:            CRUD for JSON data with Redis storage

description: This snaplet provides HTTP API to /c/reate, /r/ead,
                     /u/pdate and /d/elete JSON objects sent by client
                     and stored in Redis key-value cache. CRUD methods
                     are mapped to HTTP `POST`, `GET`, `PUT` and
                     `DELETE`. Valid objects are described using model
                     definition syntax, which includes information on
                     fields and permissions. The snaplet supports
                     role-based user permissions system as implemented
                     by Snap authentication. Model definitions may
                     also be used by browser JavaScript to provide
                     interface to create or edit objects.

                     There is a permission-less transparent mode,
                     WebSocket create/delete notifications and
                     timeline method to serve information about
                     recently added objects. Ad-hoc search is
                     implemented in Redis and provided via snaplet
                     route.

                     There's a "snapless" part of the package, which
                     implements Snap-agnostic Redis CRUD operations
                     for key-value pair collections and may be used
                     for tools which operate with storage directly
                     without using web framework.
